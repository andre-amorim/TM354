Additionally, the module introduces students to UML (Unified Modeling Language), a widely used visual modeling language for software development. By mastering UML, students will be able to create comprehensive and well-structured software designs.

**Key Learning Outcomes:**

1. **Grasp the fundamentals of software engineering and its role in creating robust solutions.**

2. **Master various software development methodologies, including agile approaches, to adapt to project requirements.**

3. **Apply testing techniques throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure quality and reliability.**

4. **Analyze and design software solutions effectively, catering to the needs of stakeholders and users.**

5. **Develop proficiency in implementing software solutions using Java, Jakarta EE, and JavaScript.**

**Development Environments and Collaboration Tools:**

Throughout the module, you will gain hands-on experience with various development environments and collaboration tools to enhance your software development workflow. These include:

**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):**

* **NetBeans:** A comprehensive IDE for Java and Jakarta EE development.

* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A popular cross-platform IDE with support for various programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

**Git:** A distributed version control system for managing project code and collaborating with others.

**GitHub:** A cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories, enabling seamless collaboration among team members.

**GitHub Codespaces:** A fully managed development environment that allows you to develop and test code directly in the cloud, without the need to install or manage any software locally.

By familiarizing yourself with these tools, you will become a more efficient and productive software developer, ready to tackle complex projects and collaborate effectively with colleagues.

All the best,
Andre.
